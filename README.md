# Insurance-Data-Regression-Problem:-

The project provides a Regression on the Insurance Prediction Data which shows the features of individuals, tuned using Ridge & Lasso.

Consider the data present in the Insurance dataset file.
Following is the attribute related information:

age: age of primary beneficiary
sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
smoker: Smoking, yes or no
region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

# Problem statement:

To predict the approximate insurance cost based upon the rest of the features provided for each individual.

# Outcome:

It predicts the approximate insurance cost based upon the features provided for each individual. It is a Regression problem. The algorithm used in this project is Linear Regression. Executed the steps like Data preprocessing, Feature selection, Model Building, Evaluation & Tuning.

# Conclusion:

Performed Base Linear Regression and Tuned using Ridge & Lasso Techniques. Out of Both, Ridge is giving the lowest RMSE (0.48) and R-Squared (0.704), Adj-R Squared (0.703) are Closed to each other.
